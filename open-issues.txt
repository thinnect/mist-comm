* Addressing needs to be generalized - EUI addressing at the core, but support
  for link locals. Special union typedef? void* pointer seems unclear, where do
  you get the size of the actual thing on your platform?

* Should am group be exposed in some generic way - do we need this concept for something?

* Think AM id is too short, but if we expand it, how do we handle compatibility
  with legacy applications. Protocol / application / type / port ... what would
  be the best term to use for the general concept?

* Timestamping should really be marked somehow in packet, previously "special"
  AM ID 0x3D was used, but does not seem like a good way forward. Perhaps just
  reserve the timestamp area always?

* Timestamping needs clock source - must be provided somehow.

* Thoughts about where to implement retries ...
	* further down the line we probably want an e2e "reliable" transport
